# Welcome to the Workout Tracker </br>
                   
Congratulations on making it this far. </br>
I was sure something would've broken by now. </br>
But here we are. </br>
                   
In any case, let's get started. </br>
The sidebar navigation should help you get around. </br>
If you come across any issues, please let me know, and I'll get onto fixing it ASAP. </br>
For now though, it is in super early development, so please try and break i?. </br>
                   
Good luck, and have a G lift! </br>
